#End-to-End test with Protractor

=========

##Prerequisites

This assumes that you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org), [npm](https://npmjs.org/), [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/) installed.

Protractor uses the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test framework for its testing interface.

## Getting Started

Install Protractor globally with:

```shell
npm install -g protractor
```

Then download the necessary binaries with:

```shell
npm install
bower install
```

Now start up a server with:

```shell
webdriver-manager start
```

To run the test use:

```shell
protractor conf.js
```
